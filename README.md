# Marine AI Project with Gemini Text and Image Recognition

## Overview

This project integrates AI-based text and image recognition capabilities with a focus on the marine industry. Using **Gemini Text** and **Image Recognition Models**, the system is designed to extract important information from documents, images, and handwritten texts. It leverages **Angular** for the frontend and **FastAPI** and **Python** for the backend, ensuring a robust and efficient AI-driven solution.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Models**: Gemini Text and Image Recognition
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **OCR**: Integration with EasyOCR and other recognition tools for extracting text from images
- **Database**: [Add your database technology here, if applicable]
- **Deployment**: [Mention your deployment platforms and CI/CD pipeline, if any]

## Features

- **Marine Document Recognition**: The system can process images and documents related to marine activities, extracting text such as bill details, item descriptions, customer information, and other relevant fields.
- **Text and Image Extraction**: AI models accurately recognize and extract handwritten or printed text from images, enabling seamless integration with Angular for real-time interaction.
- **FastAPI Backend**: The FastAPI server handles API requests from the frontend and interacts with AI models, ensuring fast and efficient data processing.
- **Angular Frontend**: The Angular application provides a user-friendly interface for displaying the extracted information and interacting with the system.
- **AI-Powered Search**: Enables searching and filtering of extracted data such as customer names, bill numbers, and more.
